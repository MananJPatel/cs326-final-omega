4. *Innovative Idea* - Our project is a tool to help UMass Computer Science students design their schedule. Students are able to enter in the classes they've taken and in return are shown all the potential classes they will be able to take, and plan out the future of their college career. Students will also be able to add reviews and feedback for specific courses, such as how many exams, time spent doing homework, and difficulty of classes.

Our application has a slight resemblance to RateMyProfessors.com, in that it allows students to look at past reviews of classes written by past students who took the course. However, our application will be specific to UMass, and it will emphasize experience with the class rather than with the professor. Otherwise, it is not very similar to any other application we know of, as it has a very specific purpose.

5. *Important Components* - Students will be able to sign in to write or view reviews on courses in order to choose the best class for them. Students can see information regarding every class - reviews, prerequisites, teachers, homeworks, other resources, exams etc. Also, students will be able to enter the courses that they have already taken in order to see what courses they are eligible for (based on prerequisites, year, etc.), as well as what courses, or types of courses, they still need to take in order to fulfill requirements.
