4. *Innovative Idea* - Our project design is a scheduler for UMass Computer Science students. Students are able to enter in the classes they've taken and in return are shown all the potential classes they will be able to take, and plan out the future of their college career. Students will also be able to add reviews and feedback for specific courses, such as how many exams, time spent doing homework, and difficulty of classes.

5. *Important Components* - Students will be able to sign in to write reviews on courses, see other reviews, and choose whatever class they want. Students can see information regarding every class - reviews, prerequisites, teachers, home-works, other resources, exams etc.
