4. *Innovative Idea* - Our project is a tool to help business people and developers alike work on independent projects. For entrepreneurs, this will be where they find the coders for their "million dollar app idea". They can submit their idea and look for people to help them accomplish it. Developers can do the same if they're just looking for help with their latest project. The idea is for people to have an account that tells a little about their coding and project experience. User accounts can have a tag or description that shows past projects, coding languges known and at what level, project desires/needs, etc. We can allow people to search for others that they think could contribute on their project based on their skills, or we could implement a system that matches people with similar coding backgrounds if they don't want to do it manually. Ideally, this site greatly facilitates the creation of indepedent projects among developers and startups, as well as  introduces the business aspect into it. As far as our group knows, there are not other sites that do what ours is designed to do, at least in this specific manner. Many other project finding resources are on a platform like Reddit that is not specifically designed to facilitate the creation of a project team. Our site can hopefully fill this role for people looking to start independent projects in a group. 

5. *Important Components* - Students will be able to sign in and choose their purpose of coming to the website. They can choose from developers, investors, explorer. They fill out their profile and can see projects aligned with their specific profiles. So investors can see all open projects, web developers can see website related projects, and explorers can see new projects being built from scratch. Developers can form a team to work on something and get feedback from the other users. Screens - Choose, profile, discover all the projects, join a project - as a developer, explorer, or an investor.
